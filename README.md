# Bubble Sweeper

Bubble Sweeper is a neon-drenched remake of Minesweeper where bubbles replace bombs and the soundtrack lives in your browser. It is a single-page playground that mixes glassmorphism visuals, gentle synth pops, and a fully responsive board so it looks great from ultrawide monitors down to pocket-sized screens.

## Highlights
- Responsive layout that keeps the title and stats center-stage on any device.
- Three handcrafted difficulty presets with first-click safety and smart bubble placement.
- Animated bubble pops, floating cells, and over-the-top win screen celebrations.
- Built-in hint system to nudge you toward safe moves when the board gets tense.
- Lightweight Web Audio cues for reveals, flags, victories, and bubble-bursting losses.

## Play It
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `bubble sweeper.html` in your favorite modern browser.
3. Pick a difficulty, press **New Game**, and start popping.

No build tools or package installs are required. Everything runs client-side.

## How to Play
- Left-click to reveal a cell.
- Right-click (or long-press on touch devices) to flag a suspicious bubble.
- Numbers show how many bubbles touch each revealed cell.
- Clear every safe cell to win. Hit a bubble and the whole board floods.
- The hint button highlights a guaranteed safe reveal when you need a lifeline.

## Tech Stack
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external frameworks).
- CSS custom properties and media queries for the responsive design.
- Web Audio API for procedural sound effects.

## Roadmap Ideas
- Daily challenge mode with seeded boards.
- Speedrun timer and personal best tracking.
- Accessibility presets (high-contrast palette, screen reader optimizations).
- Shareable replay links so friends can attempt the same board.
